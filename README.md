# My Repos

Most of my career work has been all proprietary, so there's nothing here with any *'s. But there a a few things worth pointing out;

* 2022/02 mqtt-load-test https://github.com/1MikeMakuch/mqtt-load-test
This is a script for testing, experimenting with mqtt brokers. It allows you to create many mqtt clients for subscribe and publish. It uses either the mqtt or aws mqtt client modules.

* 2021/04 audioReview https://github.com/1MikeMakuch/audioReview
This is a very simple MERN (MySQL, Express, React, Node) app. Allows users to listen to various digital audio files and make comments and likes and read the comments and likes by others.

* 2001 muzikbrowzer https://github.com/1MikeMakuch/muzikbrowzer https://Muzikbrowzer.com
This is a Windows Desktop app I wrote in the early 2000s. Written in C++ & MFC. At one time I had a few hundred users. I still use it.

* 2007 Backtest
I don't have this code in Github because there is a commercial lib used. But I have screenshots and verbiage describing it here: https://1mikemakuch.com/?p=93
