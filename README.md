# My Repos

Most of my career work has been all proprietary, so there is no "real" open source here with any *'s. But there are few things worth pointing out;

* 2022/02 mqtt-load-test https://github.com/1MikeMakuch/mqtt-load-test
This is a script for testing, experimenting with mqtt. It allows you to create many mqtt clients for subscribe and publish. It uses either the mqtt or aws mqtt client modules. There is a short video explanation linked therein.

* 2021/04 audioReview https://github.com/1MikeMakuch/audioReview
This is a very simple Node/React/MySQL app. Allows users to listen to various digital audio files and make comments and likes and read the comments and likes by others. Shows my preference for clean and simple code.

* 2001 muzikbrowzer https://github.com/1MikeMakuch/muzikbrowzer https://Muzikbrowzer.com
This is a Windows Desktop app I wrote in the early 2000s. Written in C++/MFC. At one time I had a few hundred users. I still use it.

* 2007 Backtest
I don't have this code in Github because there is a commercial lib used. But I have screenshots and verbiage describing it here: https://1mikemakuch.com/?p=93
It's written in C++/MFC.

* ~2000 ntob - i.e. number to base https://github.com/1MikeMakuch/ntob Converts a number from one base to another.
I coded in C/C++ for many years early in my career. This is a little utility I still use at least once a month.

* ~2000 commas https://github.com/1MikeMakuch/commas
I use shells (bash) a lot in my daily work flow for all kinds of things, including use of multiple pipes and filters from one command to another. This little C program simply looks for numbers in stdin and inserts a commas for readability.
